In an INTERVIEW...

HR: "What's your salary expectation "
Candidate: $8,000 to 10,000 a month.
HR: You are the best-fit for the role but I'm afraid we can't afford you.

Candidate: Okay. $7,000 would be fine.
HR: How soon can you start?

Meanwhile the budget for that particular role is $15,000. HR feels like they did a great job in salary negotiation and management will be happy they cut cost for the organisation.

The new employee starts and notices the pay disparity. Guess what happens? Dissatisfaction. Disengagement. Disloyalty.

Two months later, the employee leaves the organization for a better job. The recruitment process starts all over again. Leading to further costs and performance gaps within the team and organisation.

In order to attract and retain top talent, please pay people what they are worth.
